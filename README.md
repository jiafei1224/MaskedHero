# MaskedHero
MakeMIT 2020 table 17 project
Our project is call “Masked Hero” which is an attachment device that allows user to put onto any N95 masks, and it will be able to calculate out the lifespan of the mask which is about 8 hours on average depending on different individuals. This is achieved using sensors such as accelerometer, temperature & humidity sensor to track and compute out the rate of decaying of the mask due to usage. This is to help prevent mask wastage especially during this period whereby there is a huge global outbreak of coronavirus.
